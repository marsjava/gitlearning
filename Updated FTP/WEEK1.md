# Workshop material - Day #1 - Git/VS Code
  * Setting up git
    * Open "https://github.com/HexaInnovLab" in your browser; bookmark this page in your browser
    * Click the signup on the top-right
    * In the following instructions, {hexawareid} is the part preceding @hexaware.com in your email address
    * your username is {hexawareid}-Hexaware, e.g., krishnakumar-Hexaware
    * Use hexaware email address as the email address
    * Select your own password
    * Tell the facilitator the username just created
    * You will get mail to verify your mail address; click the link to complete the verification
    * The facilitator will add you to the hexaware github organization and also give you access to the team's repository
    * You will get a mail inviting you to the HexaInnovLab organization. Please join the organization.
    * Open https://github.com/HexaInnovLab/ftp47, and look at the WEEK1.md
    * Follow the instructions as in https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/
      * Skip "Checking for existing SSH keys" as this is a fresh installation
      * Run the ssh-keygen command and save the private key in C:\users\Hvuser\.ssh\id_rsa. *Do not* use a passphrase in step #4 - just press enter twice.
      * Skip "Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent" section as we do not use ssh-agent
      * Follow the instructions as in "https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/" and "https://help.github.com/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection/" and test the setup

  * Command Line/Gitbash --  Open Gitbash
    
    * `pwd` -- Check and verify that the current working directory is C:\users\Hvuser
    * `cd workspace` -- change current working to workspace
    * `pwd` -- Check and verify that the current working directory is C:\users\Hvuser/workspace
        
  * Git (setup/checkout/clone/pull/push)
    * `git --version` // should be atleast 2.14+
    * `git config --global -l` // should throw an error
    * `git config --global user.name "<your name>"`
    * `git config --global user.email <your email>`
    * `git config --global -l`
    * Open https://github.com/HexaInnovLab/ftp47
      * look at source code organization
    * Go back to gitbash and clone the project
    * `pwd` -- Check and verify that the current working directory is C:\users\Hvuser/workspace
    * `git clone git@github.com:HexaInnovLab/ftp47.git`
    * `cd ftp47`
    * `git status`
  * open Visual Studio Code
    * Open folder c:\users\Hvuser\workspace\ftp47
    * Browse the directories to understand the repository structure

# Workshop material - Day #2 - MySQL Workbench/Cli/Curl/Browser to interact w/ application

  * Open MySQL Workbench
  * Open the localhost connection
    * Mac OS: `export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/MySQLWorkbench.app/Contents/MacOS` and then you can use the command line `mysql -u root -phexawareftpdev`
  * `CREATE DATABASE ftp47;` and click the lightning button
  * `CREATE USER 'ftp47'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ftp47';`
  * `GRANT ALL ON ftp47.* TO 'ftp47'@'localhost';`
  * Open database/database.ddl in VS code
  * Copy the entire contents to MySQL Workbench
  * Execute the ddl 
  * Click the table icon against the EMPLOYEE table in the right-hand side schemas section
  * Open database/database.dml in VS code
  * Copy the contents to MySQL Workbench
  * Execute the dml 
  * Click the table icon against the EMPLOYEE table in the right-hand side schemas section. You should see the data just inserted.
  * Play around with
    * SELECT with predicates
    * UPDATE statements with predicates
    * DELETE statements with predicates
    * At the end of all the playing around, leave the database with 5 records with ids (1000, 2001
    
  * Next, we will build and run the java code
  * go to gitbash, ensure you are in workspace/ftp47
  * `cd restservice/leavemanager`
  * `mvn compile`
  * `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.hexaware.ftp47.util.CliMain`
    * As expected, the cli displays only the employee id for the employee; we need to do some code changes before the other attributes such as name will start appearing in the cli. But before that we will test the application as a REST service.
    * Due to a bug in the database connection code, after exiting, there will be an error with a stack trace. Ignore this error.
  * Build the war file as follows:
    * `mvn package` -- This build a war (java web archive with the code for the REST service)
    * `cp target/ftp47-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war /D/FTP/apache-tomcat-8.5.16-windows-x64/apache-tomcat-8.5.16/webapps/ftp47.war`
    * start tomcat and tail its logs
      * `cd D/FTP/apache-tomcat-8.5.16-windows-x64/apache-tomcat-8.5.16`
      * `rm -rf logs/*`
      * `./bin/startup.sh`
      * `tail -f logs/*`
      * `curl -vvv http://localhost:8080/ftp47/api/employees | python -m json.tool`
      * `curl -vvv http://localhost:8080/ftp47/api/employees/2000 | python -m json.tool`
   * `cd ../../webui/lm-app/`
   * `npm install`
   * `ng build`
   * `cp ../../restservice/leavemanager/target/ftp47-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war ./ftp47.war`
   * `cd dist`
   * `jar -uvf ../ftp47.war *`
   * `cd ..`
   * `jar -tvf ftp47.war`
   * `cp ftp47.war /D/FTP/apache-tomcat-8.5.16-windows-x64/apache-tomcat-8.5.16/webapps/ftp47.war`
   * Notice that the tail terminal shows that the new version of the web application archive is now getting deployed
   * Open Chrome browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/ftp47/
   * You should be able to see the employee ids as you have entered them in the local mysql database

# Workshop material - Day #3 - Git workflow

In this workshop, we will get familiar with

  * The git development cycle - see CHEATSHEET.md, git/development cycle
  * Branching, Reviewing, Merging
  * Resolving conflicts
  
We will learn to this by playing tic-tac-toe within each group. Play as many rounds as needed to get the hang of how we use git for branching and merging, by letting different members play different roles in each round.

In this, let's use TTT-99 for the Jira Ticket number which is needed for branch naming.

## Playing without conflicts

Split the group into two teams of two each and one reviewer, say team-X and team-O. Choose who goes first, perhaps by coin toss.

In this, team-X use one desktop in a shared manner and play 'X's while team-O share another desktop and play 'O's.

The team that goes first follows the git process to checkout and change tictactoe.html to add 'X' or 'O' in a cell. The reviewer
merges the change - after verifying that the game is not over and the team has added only one cell.

Then the second team plays in a similar manner. This continues until the reviewer decides that the game has been won, or is a draw.

The reviewer then cleans up tictactoe.html. One of the others review and merge this change.

Play as many rounds as needed till everyone is comfortable with git operations. The git commands should become 'muscle' memory - the ability to run these commands without referring to the cheatsheet.

## Playing with conflicts

Here, the team members play their turns individually on their desktops; say team-X has two members X1 and X2. Both start their turns simultaneously, by pulling master and checking out branches.

The reviewer will merge one, but the second pull request can not be auto-merged. So the player who goes second needs to resolve the conflict. S/he looks at the change as made by the first player and her own change and chooses the better of the two. If hers is better, this is another pull request for the reviewer to merge.

Play as many rounds as needed till everyone is comfortable with git conflict resolution.
